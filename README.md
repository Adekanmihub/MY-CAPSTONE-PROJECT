   3. Data validation
   4. Table creation.
   5. Excel Formulars
   6. power querry for data cleaning,
   7. Data Analysis : The data was analyzed using googlesheets, utilizing pivot table to organize, summarize and filter the data 
   8. Data visualization : Power Bi was used for the dashboard building and presentation

      - Github - For Portfolio Building .

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation

   1. Data loading and inspection
   2. Data cleaning and formatting
   3. Handling misssing variables
   4. Deleting empty colums
      
### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the data and using it to answer some questions such as : 

1. What is the total sales of product
2. what is the average sales of product
3. Which product is perfoming well
4. which region is top performing
5. what is the revenue generated by each region

Below are some few answers based on my exploration

* Based on the data that was given for the project , some colums were missing such as revenue, total revenue by region, i was able to explore the excel formular to get that by multiplying unit sold by quantity to get the revenue and SUMIF function to get the total revenue by region.
* With the use of pivot table , i was able to get the average sales by product, sales by region and total sales by product.
* I explored power bi tools build and visualize a dashboard showing the sales overview, top-performing products, and  regional breakdowns.

### DATA INSIGHT

The dashbaord tells a story.....

### Data Analysis
 This is where I include formula used, which are
 ```EXCEL
   =(F2*G2)
  =SUMIF(D:D,"East",H:H)```

```SQL
   =SELECT
  =SUMIF(D:D,"East",H:H)```
