   2. Data validation
   4. Table creation.
   5. Excel Formulars
   6. power querry for data cleaning,
   7. Data Analysis : The data was analyzed using googlesheets, utilizing pivot table to organize, summarize and filter the data 
   8. Data visualization : Power Bi was used for the dashboard building and presentation

      - Github - For Portfolio Building .

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation

   1. Data loading and inspection
   2. Data cleaning and formatting
   3. Handling misssing variables
   4. Deleting empty colums
      
### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the data and using it to answer some questions such as : 

1. What is the total sales of product
2. what is the average sales of product
3. Which product is perfoming well
4. which region is top performing
5. what is the revenue generated by each region

Below are some few answers based on my exploration

* Based on the data that was given for the project , some colums were missing such as revenue, total revenue by region, i was able to explore the excel formular to get that by multiplying unit sold by quantity to get the revenue and SUMIF function to get the total revenue by region.
* With the use of pivot table , i was able to get the average sales by product, sales by region and total sales by product.
* I explored power bi tools build and visualize a dashboard showing the sales overview, top-performing products, and  regional breakdowns.

### DATA INSIGHT

1.TOTAL SALES/ TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION

* There is a noticeable drop in the sales and revenue of north, west and east region which implies that the marketing strategies of those region should be looked into by introducing a new strategy but the reason for the drop has to be known first if it is due to man power or climate change.
*  There is a major increase in the south , more product should be pumped there so as to get a increase in revenue and maintain a good customer relationship for growth.

2. MONTHLY PRODUCT REVENUE

* There is a noticable fluctuation in the revenue generated per product from march throgh december.This suggest potential challenge sales performance or economy condition on the users which affects revenue generation.

3. REGIONAL PERFORMANCE

* The south has the highest perfomance in sales and revenue generation hence giving a reward is not a bad idea.

4. SLICER .

* This helps us to filter per product and region to have an overall idea of everything going on the dashboard.


### CONCLUSION

The revenue data from march to december shows a concerning decline across most region ( west and north ) and products (socks, hat and jacket).The states the need for the company to analyze the reason for drop, address the challenges faced and implement new strategies to boost performance and also encourage the top performing region with incentives or cashback.


### Data Analysis

This is where I include formula used, which are

 ```EXCEL
   =(F2*G2)
  =SUMIF(D:D,"East",H:H)```
```SQL
   =SELECT
  =SUMIF(D:D,"East",H:H)```
 PIVOT TABLE.
